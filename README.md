Strip
-----

Strip is a helper package that has the code picked up from Golang html/template. This package exposes functions that should've been exposed.

The code is not mine but from [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5884). The credit for this goes to [chris@pushbullet.com](chris@pushbullet.com). Thank him if you will.
